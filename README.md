# UFO-Sightings
This is a Javascript application with D3

JavaScript code that will create a table dynamically using a dataset. The dataset is about UFO sightings in the United States.

I have created a basic HTML web page.

Appended a table with the following columns to the webpage which has new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
Date/time
City
State
Country
Shape
Comment

Created an input tag which would filter the date/time column according to the provided input and render the filtered table to the webpage. The filtered input can handle all types of cases for the strings of City, State, Country and Shape.

Here, I have created multiple input tags to filter the data.

Created input tags for
date/time
City
State
Country
Shape

Based on the search criteria, the filtered table would be generated.
